# Reservo - Origin and context

Reservo is a web application that displays upcoming events hosted in an auditorium with limited seating, allowing users to create an event as long as the chosen time slot is available for the auditorium. This project was born from the desire and challenge to experiment with various technologies in a microservices architecture, experiencing firsthand the advantages and drawbacks of its implementation.

To function properly, this project is split into five repositories:
- [Reservo Front](https://github.com/Hector-f-Romero/reservo-front)
- [API Gateway](https://github.com/Hector-f-Romero/reservo-api-gateway)
- [Event & User MS](https://github.com/Hector-f-Romero/reservo-events-user-ms)
- [Hybrid Web Socket Server](https://github.com/Hector-f-Romero/reservo-ws-ms)
- Auth (Coming soon)
  
> [!NOTE]
> I am aware that the broad separation of responsibilities in this project is not the most optimal and introduces operational complexity, but it was done intentionally to simulate what itâ€™s like to work on a large-scale project with this architecture.


## ðŸ§  About the project

This web service provides CRUD operations for the User, Event, and Seat entities, enabling event creation, listing of upcoming events, seat reservation for specific events, and other related functions. It connects to a PostgreSQL 16 database.

To learn more about Spring Boot, this project initially implemented REST controllers as a first introduction to the framework, documented with Swagger. Later, controllers were added to listen for and emit domain events via NATS.
